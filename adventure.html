          <h1>Hiking</h1>
          <p><br />
            Hiking is basically walking in nature on any path or on a specific trail.
            Hiking only requires the person to walk at a normal to a brisk pace 
            in order to reduce weight as well as get the fresh air from nature. 
            Mountain Climbing is a sport or hobby in which a person hikes or climbs a mountain.
            <br><br>
            We have a seperate trail that our visitors can take when going on a hike. 
            To ensure the safety of others through this trail, our Hiking Team is more than 
            ready to get onto their feet so that no accidents may not occur.
